### Key Insights: Understanding Traffic Behavior

Our analysis highlights critical factors influencing traffic patterns:

1. **Peak Traffic Periods**:
   - Identified high-traffic days for targeted management.
   - Strategic scheduling to optimize flow.

2. **Weather Impacts**:
   - Clear correlation between adverse weather and decreased traffic.
   - Resource allocation recommendations during severe conditions.

3. **Holiday Traffic Trends**:
   - Notable spikes during holidays, most notably New Years Day, Labor Day, Independence Day, Memorial Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.
   - Improved planning for holiday-specific demands.

## Dashboard Development

1. **Data Integration & Cleaning**
   - Unified and validated datasets
   - Addressed missing and inconsistent entries

2. **Metric Development**
   - Traffic volume by day
   - Weather condition impact analysis
   - Holiday-specific trends

3. **Visualization Strategy**
   - Temporal trends: Line Chart
   - Weather condition correlations: Horizontal Bar Chart
   - Holiday-based patterns: Bubble Chart

### Implementation Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Optimize infrastructure during peak periods.
   - Allocate resources based on weather and holiday trends.

2. **Resource Optimization**
   - Traffic flow modeling for high-volume days.
   - Enhanced public communication during adverse conditions.
